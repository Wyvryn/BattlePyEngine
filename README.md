Python Battleship Engine

## What is it?
BattlePy is a game engine that can be used to pit 2 battleship AIs against each other.

## Why Battleship?
BattlePy was created to be a fun way to encourage python development and friendly competition between developers.

Battleship is an excellent choice for building a rudimentary AI. The game is easily separated into offensive and defensive phases. The simplest solution can be implemented in just 30 lines of code. Of course, your AI may experience more success by analyzing your opponent's patterns and adapting to them.
